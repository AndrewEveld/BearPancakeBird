Our game is a simple dodge-and-catch 2D game where the player (a bear) must catch as many pancakes falling from the 
sky while also avoiding falling bowling balls. There is not much narrative structure to be said, as the game is the same 
all the way through. While there is no end goal, there is a score counter so that the player has a way of knowing how
well they are doing. The player moves the bear with their mouse as the pancakes and bowling balls fall in random locations
at the top of the screen at random times. All art used was created by others, and links to the art can be found below. 
It was very rewarding to be able to see a script or game mechanic working properly after struggling with it for a while,
such was the case with having the pancakes and bowling balls spawn in random locations.
